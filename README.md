Description:
This program visually simulates the relationship between lady bugs and aphids. LabyBugs are represented as red circles, Aphids as green circles, and empty spots as blue.
The user is able to enter parameters for the simulation like: number of each bug, number of steps to breed for each bug, and an optional starting position input for each bug you want to start with. 
Once the user has entered all setup values, they are able to control the simulation’s time/steps through the SFML window that appears after the user’s entry of parameters. This is done by entering 1-9 on the keyboard while clicked on the SFML window, which will step the simulation forward that many steps.
To stop the simulation the user can press space or 0 on the keyboard.
